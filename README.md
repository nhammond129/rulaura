# rulaura

Terrible screen ruler that uses canny edge detection to measure horizontal and vertical spans in pixels.
Vaguely based on the PowerToys screen measuring tooling, but scratched together in a few hours.
Slightly cleaned up (this was all one monolithic main.cpp at first) to be thrown on github.

## Building
